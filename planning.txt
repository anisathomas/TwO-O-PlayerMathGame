Description
Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

Details
Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.

Tasks
Task 1: Extract Nouns for Classes
  -main.rb
  -game.rb
  -turn_manager.rb
  -player.rb
  -mathQuestion.rb


Task 2: Write their roles
class(es) will contain user I/O and which will not have any?
Use gets.chomp to get input from users and puts for output
Isolate your I/O logic to one or two classes. Don't allow all your classes to interact (gets/puts) with the User
 main.rb

  game.rb
    class will contain the game loop (where each instance of the loop is the other players turn)


  turn_manager.rb
    class should manage who the current_player is

  player.rb
    manages state of the player
    3 lives


  mathQuestion.rb
    generates math question

Task 3: Peer and Mentor review
